# Stacks Automated Will Execution

## Overview
The contract ensures trustless and transparent distribution of assets among beneficiaries while providing flexibility for tax deductions, oracle confirmations, and emergency actions.

---

## Features

### 1. **Oracle-Based Death Confirmation**

- Uses a multi-signature oracle system to confirm the death of the contract owner before activating inheritance distribution.
- Configurable number of confirmations required (`required-confirmations`).

### 2. **Time-Locked Inheritance**

- Each beneficiary can have a specific lock period for their inheritance, ensuring assets are distributed only after the stipulated block height.

### 3. **NFT Inheritance**

- Beneficiaries can inherit NFTs by specifying token IDs. NFT ownership is updated on-chain upon claim.

### 4. **Inheritance Tax**

- A configurable tax percentage (`inheritance-tax`) is applied to all inherited funds for contract maintenance.

### 5. **Dispute Resolution**

- Beneficiaries can raise disputes by submitting evidence hashes.
- Disputes can be resolved via voting or manually by the contract owner.

### 6. **Phased Inheritance Release**

- Inheritance can be split into multiple phases to distribute assets incrementally.

### 7. **Emergency Controls**

- The contract owner can deactivate the contract or update the number of required confirmations in emergencies.

### 8. **Enhanced Readability**

- Multiple read-only functions provide insights into the contractâ€™s state and specific details about beneficiaries, NFT ownership, and disputes.

## Public Functions

### Initialization

- **`initialize-contract (oracle-list (list 5 principal))`**
  - Adds multiple oracles to the contract.
  - Can only be called by the `contract-owner`.

### Adding Beneficiaries

- **`add-beneficiary (beneficiary principal) (share uint) (lock-period uint) (nft-list (list 10 uint))`**
  - Adds a beneficiary with a specified share percentage, lock period, and NFT allocation.
  - Ensures the total share does not exceed 100%.

### Death Confirmation

- **`confirm-death`**
  - Allows oracles to confirm the death of the contract owner.
  - Once the required number of confirmations is reached, `death-confirmed` is set to `true`.

### Claiming Inheritance

- **`claim-inheritance`**
  - Allows a beneficiary to claim their inheritance if:
    - Death is confirmed.
    - The time lock has passed.
    - The inheritance has not already been claimed.
  - Automatically transfers NFTs and STX (after deducting the inheritance tax).

### Dispute Resolution

- **`raise-dispute (evidence-hash (buff 32))`**
  - Allows beneficiaries to raise disputes by submitting an evidence hash.
- **`resolve-dispute (disputer principal)`** (private)
  - Marks a dispute as resolved.

### Updating the Will

- **`update-will-hash (new-hash (buff 32))`**
  - Updates the hash of the last will document.

### Emergency Functions

- **`deactivate-contract`**
  - Deactivates the contract, preventing further actions.
- **`update-required-confirmations (new-count uint)`**
  - Updates the number of confirmations required for death confirmation.

### Phased Inheritance

- **`claim-phase-1 (phase-data {phase-1-claimed, phase-2-claimed, phase-1-amount, phase-2-amount})`** (private)
  - Allows beneficiaries to claim the first phase of their inheritance.
